                                        Each year, from January to August, Passerelles numériques Vietnam’s selection team completes a rigorous, four-step process to select talented and motivated underprivileged youths from seven provinces in Central Vietnam: Quảng Bình, Quảng Trị, Đà Nẵng, Quảng Nam, Quảng Ngãi, Kon Tum, Bình Định.

                                        PN Vietnam collaborates with Study Promotion Associations (SPAs) from each province, who introduce us to local high schools, and facilitate the process in accordance with local laws and customs.
                                        
                                        A special effort is made to include at least 50% young women in each class. Beyond that, priority is given to the poorest students irrespective of sex or gender identity.

                                        We always try to be able to maintain the ratio of female students in each course not less than 50%. However, above all, the first priority is still given to those with the most difficult circumstances.
                                        Mainly focusing on the poorest areas around each training center in 3 countries, the admission process consists of 4 stages:

                                    To prepare these young people to become mature and independent adults, we developed a personal development curriculum which revolves around PN’s values: Trust, Responsibility, Solidarity, Respect, and a Demanding approach. 
                                    
                                   <p>
                                    As part of this program, students live together in dormitories, located near PN Vietnam, where they learn how to become autonomous and responsible adults. They are in charge of managing a budget with which they buy food, pay for the water and electricity bills, organize cleaning and cooking shifts, solve group issues and take care of each other.
